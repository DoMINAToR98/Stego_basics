# Introduction to Steganography
"Steganography is the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the existence of the communication." <br>
In contrast to cryptography, where the enemy is allowed to detect, intercept and modify messages without being 
able to violate certain security premises guaranteed by a cryptosystem, the goal of steganography is to hide messages 
inside other harmless messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second secret message 
present.

Encryption is the practice of systematic information scrambling so that it may be unscrambled later, while  Steganography is the practice of information hiding.
Steganalysis is the process of identifying hidden content.
